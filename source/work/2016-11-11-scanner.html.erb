title: Scanner
scope: "Scanning"
intro: "As a team with UBC Rapid, UBC's rapid prototyping group, we have been building a scanning device to scan small objects. With two HD webcams and a line laser,images are captured by the onboard computer, a Raspberry Pi 2. A three-dimensional reconstruction from these images remains to be done."

<h2>Project Inception</h2>
    <p>
    At the beginning of 2016, a group of friends and I were looking to get involved in an attainable project, the goal of this effort being to improve our design skills. As we are members of UBC Rapid, it made sense to work on a project in conjunction with the club. In this way we had the financial support required, and were able to contribute to their ever-growing plethora of devices.
    </p>

<h2>CAD Design</h2>
    <p>For this project, it was decided to use a similar paradigm to the Ray, as interlocking hardboard continues to impress for ease of manufacture and low cost. The remaining designed parts were 3D printed in PLA, as is a easy material to print, and allowed for multiple iterations at low cost. Below is the 5th and final iteration of the model I designed to mount both webcams to the threaded rods. This was one of the first functional parts I designed in SOLIDWORKS.</p>

    <h2>Part Procurement/Manufacture</h2>
    <p>We sourced our parts primarily from Adafruit, for their supply of Raspberry Pi accessories. Most other components were found locally, such as both the threaded rods and hardboard from the hardware store. Check out a BOM <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y7ZaZy34SEC9h366d1Cz5L-41uhVV7i0vkYEa7q8Fk4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Most of the structure is hardboard, cut on UBC's laser cutter. The whole cutting process took about an hour.</p>
